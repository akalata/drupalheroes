# Drupal Heroes

## Designers needed!

If you're interested in contributing a new design, *thank you!* We have a list of requests in the [issue queue](https://github.com/akalata/drupalheroes/issues). Please contact one of the maintainers if you need any assistance.

## To purchase

Stickers may be purchased at https://www.stickermule.com/en/user/1070689618/stickers. There is a very slight markup added to the stickers, profits from the sale of these stickers will be used to fund future designs and to provide stickers at Drupal events.

## To request a design

1. Please [search](https://github.com/akalata/drupalheroes/search?type=issues) to see if your request already exists. If a request is found, please +1 that one.
2. Please make requests for individual characters (but feel free to cross-reference requests).
3. Please note specific character details or prominent features:
  * Instead of requesting "Green Lantern", it would be more helpful to request "Green Lantern - John Stewart" or "Green Lantern - Simon Baz"
  * Some heroes might not make very good Druplicons - for example, Superman doesn't wear a mask or headgear, so there's nothing "iconic" about his head.
  * Bonus points for including an image or two with your request.
4. Discussion on ideas for potential Drupal Heroes designs are welcome, but please be respectful. All interactions relating to this project fall under the [Drupal Code of Conduct](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc).
